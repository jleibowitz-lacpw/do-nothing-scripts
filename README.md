do nothing scripts

Started with a 'sentry' script. on-board a developer's app into sentry.io. it's not very sophisticated. you should have charmbracelet's gum installed in order to run this. a script without gum can be created too. 

also added the gum_demos.sh script. just to demo what Gum can do. 

language choice

I'm using bash here. these scripts can be in any language. python, javascript, powershell, whatever. the choice of language doesn't matter very much, just whatever works.
